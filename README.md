# Data Engineering Journey - Starting from Scratch

This repository documents my journey learning data engineering from the ground up. I'm brand new to this field and excited to share my progress, challenges, and discoveries as I build my skills. Think of this as my open notebook, tracking everything from the basics to advanced concepts.

## About Me

I'm Chandra, and I'm just beginning my exploration of data engineering. I'm drawn towards that idea od how data is becoming more and more important everyday, it's an asset for all. 
And it genuinely fasciantes me to be working with large datasets, the impact of data-driven decisions.  
Starting with zero experience, this journey will focus on learning the fundamentals and building a solid foundation.

## What You'll Find Here

This repo contains:

*   Journal: My daily/regular log of what I'm learning, the challenges I'm facing, and my "aha!" moments. 
*   Learning Resources: Links to tutorials, courses, articles, and other helpful resources.
*   Code Snippets (Eventually): As I write code, I'll store useful snippets here. This section will grow!
*   Project Ideas (Eventually): As I learn more, I'll brainstorm project ideas. This section will evolve.

## Technologies I'm Planning to Learn

I'm starting with the basics and plan to explore:

*   Python: I'll begin with Python fundamentals, essential for data manipulation.
*   SQL: Learning SQL is crucial for working with databases.
*   Cloud Computing (Eventually): I'll explore cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure later. I'll choose one to focus on initially.
*   Databases (Eventually): I'll learn about different database types (relational and NoSQL).

(This list will grow and change as I learn)

## My Learning Plan (Initial Steps)

My initial focus is:

1.  Python Fundamentals: Completing a beginner-friendly Python course to grasp syntax, data structures, and control flow.
2.  Basic SQL: Learning core SQL concepts, including querying, filtering, and joining data.
3.  Development Environment Setup: Setting up my computer with the necessary tools (Python, a code editor, etc.).
